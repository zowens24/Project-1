# Project 1- Movie Night

First dev project! For those nights, when you don't want to spend more time picking a movie than actually watching one, I have created a movie generator that will randomly chose a movie from one of the 11 movie genres to choose from. If you can't choose one of the genres, there is also a random option! Made for movie nights to be spent the right way, enjoying watching the movies!

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery

## Wireframe 
- I drew out my wireframe by hand, though I ended up changing the layout multiple times.
