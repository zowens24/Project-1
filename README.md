# Project 1- Movie Night

First dev project! For those nights when you don't want to spend more time picking a movie than actually watching one, I have created a movie generator that will randomly chose a movie from one of the 11 movie genres available. If you can't decide on a genre, a random option also exists! This is made for movie nights to be spent the right way - watching and enjoying the movies!

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery

## Wireframe 
- I drew out my wireframe by hand, though I ended up changing the layout multiple times. 

### Deploy here https://zowens24.github.io/

### Future:
- Fix CSS to allow for differenct screen sizes
- Add movies to other genres and create functionality
